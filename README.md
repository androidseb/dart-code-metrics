# DCM - MIT fork

This is a third-party fork from version 5.7.4 of dart_code_metrics, the MIT-licensed version of the dart_code_metrics project.

The version of this fork was initially changed to 6.0.0 to clearly indicate a breaking change, and future development will split from the original [dart_code_metrics](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_code_metrics/versions).

This fork is not maintained by the original authors of dart_code_metrics, and the only planned development for this third-party copy is to make library dependencies maintenance fixes.

This is not part of the official dart code metrics project, if you want to look at the official dart code metrics project, see their website here: [https://dcm.dev/](https://dcm.dev/).
